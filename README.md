The sample backend was created using the react pre made application and the command
```
npx create-react-app my-app
```
This requires node version 14+

To manage node versions I'd reccomend installing the [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm).

After installation use the below snippet to get and use node v14
```
nvm install 14
```
